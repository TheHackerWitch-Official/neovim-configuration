# neovim-configuration

This repository contains my .nvim configuration!

## Helpful Information
- Neovim configuration files are located in `~/.config/nvim/`. You may have to create this directory on a fresh installation of neovim (`mkdir ~/.config/nvim`).
- This repository contains a reference to my packet manager [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). However, *Vundle will not install correctly from this repository.* Visit Vundle's GitHub page to learn how to install it.
- Some people don't like relative line numbers. To get rid of this change `:set relativenumber` to `:set number`.
